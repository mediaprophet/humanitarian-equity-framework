Okay, this is a good start! You're right to focus on the *processes* and *qualitative states* of work rather than just the things themselves (OWL handles those well). Given that you want to use RDFS for flexibility but aren't tightly coupled to it, we can lean into descriptive terms.  Here's an expanded word list, categorized with explanations, building on yours. I'll also include some notes about where certain words might overlap and how to think about choosing the best one.

**I. Core Work & Progress (Building on your base)**

*   **idea:** Fundamental thought; starting point.
*   **concept:** A more developed idea, often with preliminary structure.
*   **notion:**  A vague or informal idea; less concrete than concept.
*   **draft:** An early version of a document or plan.
*   **work:** General term for effort expended. *Keep this core.*
*   **art:** Creative work, often implying skill and aesthetic value. (May be specific to your domain)
*   **prototype:** A tangible example used for testing/demonstration.
*   **specification:** Detailed description of requirements.
*   **study:** Systematic investigation into a topic.
*   **research:** Formal inquiry aimed at discovering new knowledge.
*   **task:**  A discrete unit of work to be completed. *Important.*
*   **episode:** A distinct part or event within a larger process (e.g., "Iteration 1").
*   **scene:**  Similar to episode, maybe more focused on context/setting.
*   **stage:** A defined point in the progression of work (e.g., "Design Stage", "Testing Stage"). *Important.*
*   **milestone:** Significant achievement marking progress. *Important.*
*   **act:**  A concrete action taken; a performance or execution.

**II. Processes & Flow (How work gets done)**

*   **process:** A series of actions leading to a result. *Keep this core, but think about sub-processes.*
*   **pipeline:** A structured sequence of stages in processing.  More automated than 'process'.
*   **workflow:** Similar to pipeline; emphasizes the movement of information/materials.
*   **iteration:** Repetitive cycle of improvement. *Very useful for Agile/development contexts.*
*   **review:** Evaluation of work, often with feedback.
*   **validation:** Confirmation that something meets requirements.
*   **verification:** Ensuring something is accurate and correct.
*   **analysis:** Detailed examination of data or information.
*   **synthesis:** Combining elements to create a new whole.
*   **experiment:** A test conducted to investigate phenomena.
*   **implementation:** Putting a plan into effect.
*   **execution:** Carrying out a task or process.

**III. Administrative & Supporting Activities (Building on your base)**

*   **admin:** General administrative tasks.
*   **bookkeeping:** Recording financial transactions.
*   **documentation:** Creating records of work and processes. *Important.*
*   **reporting:** Communicating progress and findings.
*   **planning:** Defining goals and strategies.
*   **scheduling:**  Arranging a timeline for activities.

**IV. Qualifiers & States (Describing the quality/status)**

*   **right:** A permission or entitlement.
*   **obligation:** A duty or requirement. *Good, but consider more specific terms.*
*   **constraint:** A limitation or restriction. *Very useful!*
*   **risk:** Potential for negative consequences.
*   **opportunity:** Potential for positive outcomes.
*   **challenge:**  A difficult task or problem.
*   **problem:** An issue requiring resolution.
*   **solution:** A way to overcome a challenge/problem.
*   **status:** The current state of something (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed"). *Essential.*
*   **priority:** Relative importance. *Essential!*
*   **dependency:**  A requirement for another task or process. *Important.*
*   **quality:** Standard of excellence.
*   **impact:** The effect something has.

**V. Investigation & Learning (Expanding on your base)**

*   **investigation:** Systematic examination to uncover facts.
*   **discovery:** Finding new information.
*   **insight:**  A deep understanding of a problem or situation.
*   **learning:** Gaining knowledge or skill.



**Words to Consider Removing/Merging (Potential Overlap):**

*   **scene & episode**: These are very similar. Choose one based on your domain's needs.  "Episode" might be better for iterative processes; "Scene" for more narrative contexts.
*   **study & research**: Research is generally a *type* of study, so you might just need 'research'.

**Thinking about RDFS and Ontology:**

*   **Relationships are Key:** Don't focus too much on the nouns themselves.  The power comes from how they relate to each other (using `rdfs:subClassOf`, `rdf:type`, custom properties).  For example:
    *   `Task rdfs:subClassOf Process`
    *   `Prototype rdf:type Act`
    *   `Investigation hasPart Episode`
*   **Qualifiers as Properties:** Use qualifiers (like 'status', 'priority') *as properties* to describe instances of your core concepts.  E.g., `Task1 status "In Progress"`
*   **Avoid Redundancy:** If OWL can handle a concept well, don't reinvent it in RDFS.



**To help me refine this further, tell me more about:**

*   **Your Domain:** What kind of work are you modeling? (Software development, scientific research, creative projects, etc.)
*   **Typical Workflows:**  What is a common sequence of steps in your domain?
*   **The Goal of the Ontology:** What questions do you want to be able to answer with this ontology?



This expanded list should give you a solid foundation. Let me know what you think and we can continue refining it based on your specific needs.
