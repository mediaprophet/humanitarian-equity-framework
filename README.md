# **Humanitarian Equity Framework**

**Version:** 0.001-init

**Date:** July 19, 2025

## STATUS - INIT

This repo has only just been created.  The content is being developed, is in a very early draft stage pending incorporation of historical works into a full emboidment that is intended to be contributed into this body of works online.  There are many areas that are not yet incorporated, as such, if interested - best to reach out to me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/)


## **Overview**

This repository hosts the Humanitarian Equity Framework, a system designed to track, attribute, and fairly compensate contributions to humanitarian Information and Communications Technology (ICT) projects, systems, works, and ecosystems. It emphasizes transparent code inspectability for trust, quality assurance, and collaborative review, while reserving full rights until a robust compensation mechanism is implemented. This approach ensures contributors' time, energy, expertise, and socioeconomic needs are respected, preventing uncompensated labor (often termed "digital slavery") and aligning with human rights principles such as fair remuneration and non-exploitation.

The framework distinguishes between:

* **Open-Source Inspectability**: Making source code publicly available for analysis to detect issues, ensure reliability, and foster innovation—without implying gratis or unencumbered use.  
* **Fair Compensation**: Addressing the real costs of useful work, including indirect expenses like opportunity costs and welfare maintenance, to combat exploitation and support sustainability.

Attribution and provenance are core, using tools like RDF for semantic linking and traceability across contributions and external components.

## **Project Goals**

* Define and track "Obligation Costs" (total value of compensated and uncompensated contributions).  
* Implement a compensatory system (e.g., via blockchain technologies) for equitable rewards.  
* Transition to a permissive open-source license once compensation milestones are met.  
* Support humanitarian ICT development by prioritizing ethics, inclusivity, and human rights compatibility.

## **Current Status**

This is an initial placeholder repository for defining to-do items, advancing related works, and outlining the framework. Tooling for the compensation system is under development. The project is in early stages, with source code available for inspection only under the terms of the LICENSE.

Some initial files:

* LICENSE: Details the "All Rights Reserved, Pending Compensatory Implementation" terms.  
* Ontology/: files relating to the development of ontology to support these systems; Initial template files are,
- ontology/Contributors.ttl
- ontology/cost-model.ttl
- ontology/licenseontology.ttl
- ontology/projectClaims.ttl
- ontology/projectrules.ttl

* CLAIMS\_PROCEDURE.md: Guidelines for making claims on contributed work.  
* Additional metadata files (e.g., CONTRIBUTORS.rdf, COST\_MODEL.json) for tracking costs and attributions.

## Further work items include;
- More Granular Classes: Refine the classes (e.g., different types of contributors – individual, organization, automated system).
- Specific Valuation Models: Define more specific classes for different valuation models (e.g., HourlyRateValuation, FixedPriceValuation).
- Provenance Tracking: Add properties to track the origin and validation of contribution data. (Who submitted it? When? Was it reviewed?)
- Blockchain Integration: Link this ontology to blockchain identifiers for transactions and smart contracts. (e.g., a property linking a ResourceContribution to a specific micropayment transaction).
- OWL, SHACL and related Formats: Convert the Turtle syntax into Semantic Web formats (e.g.,OWL, ShACL, RIF, RuleML, ORDL, CogAI, etc) for more powerful reasoning capabilities.

## **Inspection and Limited Access**

* **Inspect Only**: Clone the repo to review code for functionality, bugs, or improvements. No redistribution, modification, or commercial use is permitted without a functional compensation system.  
* **Contributions**: Submit pull requests or issues, but acceptance is limited to "useful work" per PROJECT\_RULES.rdf. Non-accepted contributions do not qualify for compensation claims.  
* **Reporting**: Encourage feedback via issues; reports may be considered contributions subject to compensation principles.

## **Roadmap and To-Do Items**

1. **Refine Metadata Structures**: Enhance RDF schemas for attribution, provenance, and interoperability.  
2. **Develop Compensation Tooling**: Prototype blockchain integration for micropayments and semantic contracts.  
3. **Governance Setup**: Establish decentralized mechanisms for valuations and disputes.  
4. **Milestone Tracking**: Document progress toward release criteria (e.g., 80% Obligation Cost fulfillment).  
5. **Community Engagement**: Invite inspections and discussions aligned with humanitarian goals.

Contributions to these to-dos are welcome, provided they align with the framework's principles.

## **License**

This project is governed by the custom LICENSE in this repository: "All Rights Reserved, Pending Compensatory Implementation" (Version 0.01). It reserves rights until compensation systems are functional, then transitions to a permissive license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0). All terms uphold international Human Rights Legal Instruments.

For details, see LICENSE.
